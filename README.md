# Wowza Streaming Engine OpenAPI Specifications

This repository provides an updated OpenAPI 3 specification for the Wowza Streaming Engine (WSE). While Wowza Streaming
Engine offers a Swagger specification, itâ€™s based on Swagger version 1.2. Many modern code generators and tools require
OpenAPI 3, which led to the need for a conversion and enhancement of the original specification.

This repository contains an improved, OpenAPI 3-compliant version of the Wowza Streaming Engine specification, featuring
a more complete set of operations and models. These specifications can be used directly with OpenAPI-compatible tools
and should facilitate smoother integration with modern APIs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues for any missing operations or models, or submit pull requests with
improvements.

## License

The original Swagger 1.2 files provided by Wowza Streaming Engine do not include licensing details, and I was unable to
determine a specific license for those files. This repository, containing the converted and enhanced specifications, is
licensed under the MIT License.
